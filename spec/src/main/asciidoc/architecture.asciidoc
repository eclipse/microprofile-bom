== Architecture

The MicroProfile BOM will identify the contents of each MicroProfile release.
The contents will be those features and versions agreed to by the MicroProfile community.
These features may be external to the MicroProfile community (Java EE features such as JAX-RS 2.0), or they be a component of the MicroProfile project (such as Config 1.0).

Since the MicroProfile BOM is an "umbrella" project, there will be no individual API or TCK generated for this component.
Only this Specification will be generated and maintained to document the contents of each release.

In reverse chronological order, here's the specification for each MicroProfile release.

[[microprofile1.1]]
=== MicroProfile 1.1 (3Q2017)

MicroProfile 1.1 is the first release since becoming an https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile[Eclipse project].

Based on our time-boxed process, the content for MicroProfile 1.1 will be all of <<microprofile1.0, MicroProfile 1.0>>, plus https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config 1.0].

The Maven coordinates for this Eclipse release are as follows:
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-bom</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

[[microprofile1.0]]
=== MicroProfile 1.0 (JavaOne 2016)

MicroProfile 1.0 was released prior to becoming an Eclipse project.
MicroProfile 1.0 consisted of https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339[JAX-RS 2.0], https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346[CDI 1.2], and https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353[JSON-P 1.0] -- all of these are Java EE 7 specifications.

The Maven coordinates for this non-Eclipse release are as follows:
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
